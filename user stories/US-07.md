### US-07 Search for a reservation by phone number

As a restaurant manager<br/>
I want to search for a reservation by phone number (partial or complete)<br/>
so that I can quickly access a customer's reservation when they call about their reservation.<br/>

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. The `/search` page will
   - Display a search box `<input name="mobile_number" />` that displays the placeholder text: "Enter a customer's phone number"
   - Display a "Find" button next to the search box.
   - Clicking on the "Find" button will submit a request to the server (e.g. GET `/reservations?mobile_number=800-555-1212`).
     - then the system will look for the reservation(s) in the database and display all matched records on the `/search` page using the same reservations list component as the `/dashboard` page.
     - the search page will display all reservations matching the phone number, regardless of status.
   - display `No reservations found` if there are no records found after clicking the Find button.

> **Hint** To search for a partial or complete phone number, you should ignore all formatting and search only for the digits.
> You will need to remove any non-numeric characters from the submitted mobile number and also use the PostgreSQL translate function.
>
> The following function will perform the correct search.
>
> ```javascript
> function search(mobile_number) {
>   return knex("reservations")
>     .whereRaw(
>       "translate(mobile_number, '() -', '') like ?",
>       `%${mobile_number.replace(/\D/g, "")}%`
>     )
>     .orderBy("reservation_date");
> }
> ```
